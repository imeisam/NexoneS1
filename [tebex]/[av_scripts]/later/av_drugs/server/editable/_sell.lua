    How corner selling works?:
    1) You need one of the Config.Sells items in your inventory
    2) Drive to one of the whitelisted zones (every drug have a list of whitelisted zones or "ALL" to sell anywhere)
    3) Use the target system on your vehicle trunk
    4) If you have the drug item you will be able to see the "Sell X drug"
    5) Vehicle trunk will open and the sell loop will start
    6) Every X seconds the script will pick a random NPC from the street to buy you drugs
    7) Use the target system with that NPC and select the Offer option
    8) NPC can reject your offer or accept it and call cops
    9) For dispatch events/exports is on you to add it, my script doesn't sends any alert to cops (check client/editable/dispatch.lua)
    10) Player receives money and we go back to step 6

    If you are NOT using qb-target or ox_target you can find the target functions in client/editable/target.lua
